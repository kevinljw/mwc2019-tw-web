    "Scenario": "A-Rong smells a foul odor in his sleep. \u201cIt must come from that factory!\u201d Recently A-Rong was awakened by a foul odor and his neighbors have also claimed to have smelled the unconformable odor. They have reported to the local Environmental Protection Agency, but no evidence is found. \u201cThey emit pollutants during the night. That is the reason why EPA cannot find any evidence,\u201d says A-Rong angrily.",
