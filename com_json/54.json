With data collected from the smart street lights uploaded to the cloud platform, it is easy to manage the sensing devices. It will also be more cost effective to build standardized street light poles, in which power cables and internet cables can be installed so as to reduce the installation costs of pipelines and devices.", "adopted_technology": "Environmental sensing devices and cloud", "benefits": ["1. Easier maintenance for street lights to increase efficiency", "2. Standardized street light poles can reduce the installation costs of pipelines and devices", "3. Data collected from the smart street lights can be utilized and interpreted for facility city management"], "solution_description": "This solution incorporates environmental sensors on intelligent street lights to meet the requirements of electricity and connectivity, and makes it possible for future attachments of devices for V2X and base stations. It also reduces the cost of installing sensors by standardizing design of the street light for wires and within the light pole.", "solution_provider": "Chunghwa System Integration", "reference_site": "Hsinchu Nanliao Fishing Port area", "contact": ""}
